# nazca

Nazca is a Rails 3 / Rails 4 plugin to easily deal with all your `<title>` and `<meta>` tags, making your app more usable for people and more visible for search engines.

## Why?

Using instance variables for this purpose seemed so scruffy. Wrapping some code in this little plugin made my layout templates much smaller and cleaner as I could add all my meta tags in a single line of code.

## Usage

```erb
<%= meta_tags "My awesome little site" %>
```

will yield: `<title>My awesome little site</title>`

```erb
# In views/posts/new.html.erb
<% title "Creating a post" %>

# In views/layouts/application.html.erb
<%= meta_tags "My awesome little site" %>
```

gives `<title>My awesome little site | Creating a new post</title>`.

You can specify the title inside a header tag as the `title` method returns the title itself:

```erb
<h1><%= title "Creating a post" %></h1>
```

### Reversing order

```erb
<%= meta_tags "My awesome little site", :reverse => true %>
```

which yields `<title>Creating a new post | My awesome little site</title>`

### Setting a custom separator

```erb
<%= meta_tags "My awesome little site", :reverse => true, :separator => "::" %>
<title>Creating a new post :: My awesome little site</title>
```

### Setting description and keywords meta tag:

```erb
<% title "Creating a post" %>
<% keywords "omg,so,sweet" %>
<% description "Cute cats programming Ruby." %>
<%= meta_tags "My awesome little site" %>

<title>My awesome little site | Creating a post</title>
<meta content="Cute cats programming Ruby." name="description" />
<meta content="omg,so,sweet" name="keywords" />
```

## Why there are no controller methods to globally set up meta tags?

Because I respect MVC. Meta tags are views-specific.
